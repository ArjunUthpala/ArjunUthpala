👋 Hi there! I’m Arjun Uthpala Waththegedara — a results-driven Software Engineer and Team Lead at Parallax Technologies (Pvt) Ltd. Over the past three years, I’ve architected and delivered end-to-end solutions using PHP/Laravel, Vue.js, Flutter, MySQL, and Redis, while mentoring junior developers and ensuring the successful rollout of production-grade software.

🔧 What I Do:

Full-Stack Development: I specialize in building robust APIs and microservices in Laravel, intuitive functional UIs with Vue.js, and cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter.

System & Database Design: I design scalable system architectures and ensure high-performance database structures with a strong focus on data reliability.

Technical Leadership: I lead by example—offering mentorship, technical guidance, following up sprints, and conducting detailed code reviews that uplift team standards.

💬 What Sets Me Apart:

Excellent communication skills that bridge the gap between technical and non-technical parties within organization

A can-do attitude and a strong sense of ownership—I take initiative, adapt quickly, and thrive both team and project forward

Passion for collaborative problem-solving and delivering real-world impact through code

🌍 Looking Ahead:
I’m open to remote or hybrid opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully, grow alongside a strong team, and help build scalable, impactful software.

🛠 Other Skills:
I have a basic understanding of DevOps concepts such as CI/CD, server management, monitoring, traffic analysis and manage server costs and I'm always eager to expand my skillset in that direction.
